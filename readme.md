# HOW MUCH YOU SPEND ON SHOWROOM

### Introduction

* This script uses Selenium to log and save the cookies and then run through the purchase gold pages to get all the data from the table and save them into .csv
* Also, I include a little script to calculate the total spending
* The code does not look good because I rushed it
* The reason why I rush is because I would like to stop spending on the showroom by horrifying amount of money spending on it
* Good luck
